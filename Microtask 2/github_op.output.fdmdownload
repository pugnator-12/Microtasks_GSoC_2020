It provides him with that user's discord ID, the slur used + the discord link to the message.\r\n\r\n2) Role Restriction Handler -> As there are upcoming plans for making messaging disabled for the 'everyone' role and creating a new role that everyone would get as soon as they join the channel and react to the rules post in #__init__. Here's the features - When someone new joins the channel, they will be sent an embed message giving the instructions to go to the #__init__ channel, read the rules, and like the post to remove their restriction. As soon as they react to the post, they will be auto handed the new role!  If somehow the bot is offline and they react, the bot will come online and then assign the role to those who reacted! It'll also check for members who reacted but left the channel to prevent errors. \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT** \r\nThere is a vacant space for the new role's id as it wasn't created on the time of sending  this PR. On line 74 of the code, cmn_role variable is created without being assigned the id. Just assign it the role id and that's all there is to be done!",
